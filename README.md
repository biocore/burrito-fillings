brokit
======

The Biological Research (application controller) Obsolescence Kit (brokit - canonically pronounced 'brah-kit') package contains [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org) [CommandLineApplication](https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio/blob/master/skbio/app/util.py#L161) subclasses (i.e., *application controllers*) for bioinformatics applications. This is intended to be a temporary package for the application controllers that are used in QIIME as we figure out which of these we will continue to support.

**Note:** brokit is currently under active development and its API is not stable. Major compatibility-breaking API changes will likely happen as development progresses.
